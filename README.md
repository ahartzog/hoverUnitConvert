# hoverUnitConvert

A tool to detect units being hovered over and convert them from imperial to metric and vice versa

## Installation

Require the library on pages where you want the function available to convert units

## Usage

This tool specifically will only convert the units. When used in collaboration with a tooltip generator, hovering over a unit of one system will show the converted units of the other. E.g. hovering over "2cm" would generate a tooltip showing ".78in" and vice versa

## To Dos

PHASE 1:

1. Determine how to detect a numerical value followed by a unit symbol on hover
2. Write script that will detect when a numerical value followed by a unit symbol being hovered over
3. Create a set of unit conversions (inches to centimeters, feet to meters, etc and vice versa)
4. Return the converted value

PHASE 2:

1. Build or integrate a tooltip to show the converted value 


## Ideas

* Package as a wordpress plugin
* Add tooltip themes
* Add ability for custom tooltip styling
* Add different tooltip locations
