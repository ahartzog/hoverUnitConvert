# hoverUnitConvert

A tool designed to detect units being hovered over and convert them

## Installation

Require the library on pages where you want the function available to convert units

## Usage

This tool specifically will only convert the units. When used in collaboration with a tooltip generator, hovering over a unit of one system will show the converted units of the other. E.g. hovering over "2cm" would generate a tooltip showing ".78in" and vice versa
